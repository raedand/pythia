To be seen all

day: I search, even now, for things 
to hide. Is this why

the rose stays still? Why the bulbul,
sadly, sings?


I even launder/ with you


You watch the clothes
like a child. They turn

in your eyes. 

There is nothing
of Urdu poetry here,
at least.


In Faiz's Spring


Outside it is cold 
and my hair falls without
 
grace. I am beautiful
then, if only 

for a moment: there is
a mirror where my nose 
is holy.


What if/ he was never mad/ to begin with

At home you warm 
water in the kettle,
fold my night 

like cloth, lift it 
so it dances with the dust.
