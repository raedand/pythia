Nobody will know
how those times passed.
Nobody will tell you
the inside facts of those times.

The years threw heaps of shit at me,
lump after lump,
asking me to live
on shit.

For no reason, the years threw shit
ruthlessly in front of me
and behind me, into my mind and my body, too.
Those unchanging years
which couldnâ€™t even flow away
fed me shit
and left me mercilessly
alive.
