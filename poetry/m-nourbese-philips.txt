The bolt of fabric lay between us
covered in dust,
‘Burnt Sienna’, the price tag read,
seven dollars per yard
(he hadn’t gone metric yet).
“I want enough to cover one chair –
this chair here”.

The grimy light shafted us
spotlit dust
danced in particles.
He held up the shears
began to cut –
I stared
saw
(believed for the first though I knew all along),
the blue veins,
the numbered wrist.

“It’s a nice chair . . .
Yes, I could do a good job for you.
And how soon would you want it?”
Careful you measured the chair,
“In two weeks time”
I looked behind, a latter day Janus,
saw them put down the whips, take up the guns.
“You can have it before”.
I looked ahead,
they turned off the ovens, and set up the homelands.
“And how much would it cost?”
I was thinking to trade
one Roots for a Holocaust.

He measured the cloth
slowly
sending up clouds of dust,
“That’s enough now
– three yards.”
I had given ‘It’ a name –
Suffering.
silent you shook your head, mouthed,
“Persecution”
while they called it Ratings;

“Fifty dollars should do it all.”

Infinitives of silence held us apart:
to have
to understand
me, you, or the mathematics of it all
(you hadn’t gone metric yet anyway).
New math they called it,
and we were the B.C.D.’s – Basic Common Denominators –
silence divided by time,
one oppression by two realities;
the only remainder, one scrawny wrist
tattooed blue with numbers,
and branded memories that balk at talk.
