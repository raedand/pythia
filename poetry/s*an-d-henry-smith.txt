gift horse quips back swift violence of wet
slow bird and the sand rodent testament

revisit river rotted secret
return to the wind that learned you

greys the mountain sent
crisp cry of yellow crust
t o s q u i rm in d i v i s i b le
to wry individually
to resist dichotomy
to celebrate in love and torment

plaque dangle desert deadwood
an audience of canyons shed new guilt if you can build new forgiveness if the strength mustard a yolky morning

a birthplace for scorpions
a gnat's nest by the mouthful

allow the shallow fortitudes of arrival
underbrush ingrown and ongoing and so on and so on and so on

Time will remind us of mornings and windows. An exit memorized. The removal of back flesh. A deep swig of backwash. The flies fucking on my thigh. I've got two versions: milieus we're reacting against and people we're fighting for. Every stranger in the desert. The son of other islands, our feet for mountains. This wind sing different â€” I will translate at my earliest convenience. The thunder appeased, commence our reunion. This desert this canyon three cycles prior. My body 2D, flapping. The crows again to greet me, fluent in magenta, riddled in shadow throw.

I AM SCRAMBLING WITH FLAT FEET
NAKED AS GODDESS INTENDED
UNLOCK YR MYSTERY
YOU READ ME YOU DOUBLE FOCUS YOU DOUBLE BLUR YOU VIBRATE AND UNRAVEL I AM DUMBSTRUCK IN YOUR RIVER STRIPE
DRIP DRIP SOME SICK ENAMEL A GLORY SPELL TO END YR NIGHTMARE
